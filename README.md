## Configuration

To configure your dynamic form, create a `DynoFormConfig` array with the desired field settings. Each field can have properties such as `name`, `type`, `label`, `required`, and more. Refer to the [DynoFormConfig Interface](#api-reference) for details.

<form [formGroup]="dynamicForm" dynoForm [config]="formConfig"></form>
```

## Field Customization

Customize each field with options like validation patterns, error messages, CSS classes, and more directly within the `DynoFormConfig`.

## Validation
